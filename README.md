# Canvas-Class-cpp

Canvas Class â€“ You will have to implement a Canvas class which may contain multiple shapes. In this question
you have to use the Shape class that you have already implemented in the previous assignment. You will separate
your code in three files (Canvas.h, Canvas.cpp, and Q5.cpp). A canvas can have multiple shapes but since we have
implemented Shape class earlier we would like to store information of different types of shapes separately. This
information will be stored in the Canvas class. A sample canvas is given below, an instance of your canvas should be
able to store this information.
